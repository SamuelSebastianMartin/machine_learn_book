This repo is just to keep my code as I work through the book *Hands-n Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow* by Aurélien Géron
The datasets were not available anymore, so in each case, I am using different datasets to practice the same functionality.

I would imagine that this repo has zero interest for other users.

The data itself is not uploaded because of file sizes. I will try and remember to add a link for downloading, but for ch2, I did not.
