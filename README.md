This repo is just to keep my code as I work through the book *Hands-n Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow* by Aurelien Geron
The datasets were not available anymore, so in each case, I am using different datasets to practice the same functionality.

I would imagine that this repo has zero interest for other users.
